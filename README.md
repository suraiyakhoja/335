 where `<GRAPH_FILE>` is the file used to create the graph and
 `<ADJECENCY_QUERYFILE>` is the file used to check if vertices
 are adjacent

 Example:
 `./CreateGraphAndTest Graph1.txt AdjacencyQueries1.txt`

 To run the find paths in graph routine, type:
 `./FindPaths <GRAPH_FILE> <STARTING_VERTEX>`

 where `<GRAPH_FILE>` is the file used to create the graph and 
 `<STARTING_VERTEX>` is the vertex in the graph as the starting
 point for the paths
